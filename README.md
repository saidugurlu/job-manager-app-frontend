- **What we will build**
	- we will extend our full-stack MERN application to which [we just added JWT to authenticate our users](https://edwardtanguay.netlify.app/howtos?id=589)
	- we will base our authorization on a concept of users, groups and pages
		- each user has a list of groups to which they belong
		- each page has a list of groups to which it allows access

		- passwords stored as bcrypt hashes
